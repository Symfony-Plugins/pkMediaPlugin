Specs:

It would be nice to have slugs for media just as we have slugs
  for pages. We wouldn't enforce unique titles necessarily, we'd
  just generate a slug like kitten_2 for the second occurrence
  of the title kitten.
* An embeddable media plugin for use in the trinity site and generally
* With a slot for pkContextCMS
* Direct GIF/JPEG/PNG, Viddler video, Viddler audio?
  ? Probably direct images, YouTube video, YouTube audio, with
    metadata mirrored only once and locally editable, and no refresh pulls
* Browse by one tag at a time, like Study Abroad, but you can assign
  more than one tag to a thing
* Not extensible to more types except possibly by column aggregation
  inheritance. pkMediaItem should be all you need
* Should allow you to pull any image size, and should cache that
  for next time. For performance, try to use mod_rewrite to send the
  request to Apache IFF it's not a file yet. The components of the filename
  convey several important things:

  pkMediaId
  Width
  Height (optional)
  When height is specified we crop the original
  /100/300x200.jpg
  /100/300.jpg

* Upload more than one image at a time...  but no hacks this time... 
  Symfony 1.2 file widgets made sexy
* Support for slideshows (which require multiple media items per slot)
? Support for embedding in something other than pkContextCMS
* Tagging, with multiple tags per item, unlike Study Abroad
* Folder-style browsing like Study Abroad? Or just search and
  tag filters and browse recent, like Pressroom? I am thinking like
  Pressroom because there will be A Lot Of Stuff
* What do we do about permissions?
  ? Editors group can upload. Admins can edit and delete. The person who
  uploaded something can edit or delete it.
